<h1>Data Visualization Techniques</h1>

<h2>Definition</h2>
Data visualization helps readers easily understand large data sets. Visualizations are particularly helpful when the audience of the data being presented is not already familiar with the details of the data. Examples of commonly used data visualizations include:

 + Graphs
 + Tables
 + Charts

<h2>Examples</h2>

This is a strong example of using a line graph to clearly convey different data values related to the article's topic (in this case, the Soybean market):
